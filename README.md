# Food-App

this app is made as a project in my summer intern at StorkyApp as an application on React & React hooks.

## What does the app do?
It's simply a food ordering app, that you choose from the preexisted meals and you add them into your cart.
and then you press order.

NOTE: the app in only a front-end project so ordering does not do any thing.

to try the app on your PC you will have to install the following:
- Node.js
- React.js
- Node modules by writing 'npm install' in your terminal after you open the project file in it.
